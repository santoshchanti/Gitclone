To fix these issues, kindly follow the steps below:
- First charge the device. Make sure that you use appropriate USB cable and charger.
- Then, reset the device. Hold the power button for 7 to 10 seconds, wait for 2 seconds and repeat the process once more, wait for 2 seconds then press the power button for 3 to 5 additional seconds and you will "reset" the device. Once you have reset the device, we recommend, checking the stylus pen to ensure the pen tip is inserted properly.
- Lastly, make sure that the software is up-to-date. The latest version is 3.0.1.
